  <h3>Description</h3>
  <p>One-pot spaghetti puts Italian sausage, pasta sauce, and noodles together for a dish you can have on the table in less than 45 minutes. It doesn't get much easier than this by cooking everything in one pot.</p>
  <h3>Ingredients</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>1 pound ground Italian sausage</li>
        <li>1 small white diced onion</li>
        <li>4 cloves minced garlic</li>
        <li>1 jar tomato basil pasta sauce</li>
        <li>2 cups water</li>
        <li>1 tsp Italian seasoning</li>
        <li>1 package spaghetti noodles</li>
        <li>Half cup grated Parmesan cheese</li>
    </ul>
  <h3>Steps</h3>
  <ol>
    <li>Combine ground sausage, onions, and garlic in a large pot or skillet with tall sides.</li>
    <li>Cook over medium heat until sausage is cooked through, 5 to 8 minutes. Drain and discard grease.</li>
    <li>Stir pasta sauce, water, and Italian seasoning into the pot; bring to a boil.</li>
    <li>Stir in spaghetti noodles, return to a boil, and cook, stirring occasionally, until noodles are cooked through and sauce has thickened, 17 to 20 minutes.</li>
    <li>Serve topped with grated Parmesan cheese.</li>
  </ol>
